description,"When clicking on About from the menu, you will receive the error message""The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.""","The contact form on the Demoblaze website currently accepts and processes email inputs that are not in a valid format. When a user enters an invalid email (e.g., missing ""@"" or domain), the form still allows submission and shows a confirmation message.","The contact form accepts invalid inputs in the name field (e.g., 1234, @@@, A!@#) and still sends the message successfully.","The message field does not validate meaningful content. Users can submit messages that contain only symbols or meaningless strings, which may be spam or testing noise.",The form sends a confirmation message without any input. This shows a lack of required field validation and can lead to empty or spam entries in the contact system.
